### In this [SwerveDrive implementation](https://github.com/ShawnZhuPro/SwerveDrive/tree/master/src/main/java/frc/robot) we will
```diff
+ Create 4 swerve modules
+ Create a swerve subsystem that uses these 4 modules
+ Create a teleop (joystick-operated) command to drive the chassis with swerve drive
+ Create an autonomous command that makes the chassis follow a predefined path
- Make sure to change constants according to your robot!
```
